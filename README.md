# kutils
Useful utilities missing in Kotlin stdlib or in JRE

As for now there is a couple of utilities that make life easier:

1. Some lambda function wrappers

2. And Auto.close block for Kotlin as it was decribed [here](https://discuss.kotlinlang.org/t/kotlin-needs-try-with-resources/214/#post_2)
